# HRA-vsa-HSA
HRA and HSA plans sound similar but they have very specific differences. Knowing the difference will help you make an informed decision.
Most people have a hard time understanding all the popular health insurance plan options available today.  Navigating all the different terms can be confusing; terms such as HMO, PPO, HSA High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), Exchange Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), Health Care Sharing Ministries (HCSM) and now HSA bank savings and employer funded HRA plans. Some plans are very comprehensive and expensive; others will only pay benefits after very large deductibles.

In order for most people to find an affordable health insurance premium they’re forced to settle for more out-of-pocket expenses and much higher deductibles.  TheHealth Reimbursement Arrangementand Health Savings Account can help individuals pay these higher out-of-pocket expenses using tax advantaged accounts. Both of these plans come with specific IRS, Department of Labor (DOL) and Affordable Care Act (ACA) rules and guidelines, spending limits and other eligibility criteria. Superficially, they seem to serve a similar purpose. However, there are some key similarities anddifferences between the HRA and HSA. Read on to know about them.

What is a Health Reimbursement Arrangement(HRA)?
An HRA is an employer-fundedhealth benefit plan for employees. Employees cannot contribute to the HRA; they can only be employer-funded. Employers who offer an HRA to their employees are able to design a plan that meets the specific needs of their employees. The HRA may be integrated with a group health insurance plan to pay a portion or all of a much higher health insurance plan deductible. The employer saves a lot of premium by utilizing a much higher deductible.  Then the employer uses the premium savings to fund an HRA to pay the higher deductible only for those employees who may experience one. Or, the HRA can be designed to pay specific expenses such as a co-payment, or pay just dental benefits. Other HRA designs can reimburse employees for non-group individual health insurance the employee purchases themselves. Or the HRA could pay individual health insurance and out-of-pocket medical and dental. Medical expenses that are allowed to be reimbursed can be found in IRS Publication 502. 

One drawback to the HRA is when an employee leaves the company they can’t take the HRA fund with them. Any unused funds left in the account are forfeitedand remain with the employer. Since the employer contributed to the funds, they own it.In contrast the Health Savings account (HSA) belongs to the employee when there is a change in employment. 

What is a Health Savings Account(HSA)?
A Health Savings Account is a tax-free bank savings account integrated with a HSA qualified high deductible health plan (HDHP).  Individuals can make contributions to their HSA bank savings account that can be leveraged later for qualified healthcare expenses they choose. This could include many healthcare expenses rarely covered by most health plans. The HSA does come with some amazing tax benefits.

Funds are usually contributed by the individual. But in an employer-sponsored HSA, even the employer can contribute to the fund. These funds can be used by individuals for eligible medical expenses like prescriptions drugs, dental, vision and other healthcare expenses. These expenses are tax-free!

However, there is a limit to contributions made to HSA. Thecontribution limits for 2021 are as follows:
•	Single Coverage – $ 3,600
•	Family Coverage – $ 7,250
One of the best things about HSA is that it is portable. Individuals don’t have to worry about healthcare costs after leaving employment. 

Similarities between the HRA andHSA 
•	Both HRA and HSA have been created with the idea to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for employees and their families.
•	Individuals who hold an HSA or HRA can leverage the funds to pay for eligible health expenses tax-free.
•	These healthcare accounts are a part of consumer-directed healthcare plan. They are provided to individuals so that they can actively involve themselves in personal healthcare decisions.
•	Individuals can choose when and how to spend their healthcare dollars according to the guidelines set by employers or IRS.
•	HRA and HSA plans can be employer-sponsored depending on the type of plan chosen.

Differences between the HRA andHSA
Here are some major differences between the Health Reimbursement Arrangementand the Health Savings account:

Eligibility Criteria
For HRA:
•	Only an employer can open a Health Reimbursement Arrangement for their employees.
•	ICHRA – Employers might offer it to a certain category of employees or make it open to all the employees.
For HSA:
•	A Health Savings account can be opened by individuals or an employer.
•	Individuals need to enroll themselves in an HDHP if they want to setup an HSA at a bank.
•	Unemployed, self-employed andemployees can easily open an HSA.

Account Ownership
Employees usually own the Health Savings Account whereas employers own the Health Reimbursement Arrangement. So, if an employee decides to leave the company, he/she can only retain an HSA and not the HRA.

Individuals can still have access to funds from the HSA for eligible medical expenses even after leaving the company provided; they are enrolled in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).They canalso continue to make new contributions into the HSA. The same rules apply for an employer-sponsored HSA.

Insurance RequirementsandAccount Types
The HSA is pretty straightforward. There aren’t multiple variations; just differences in deductible either minimum or maximum limits. However, individuals need to be enrolled in an eligible HDHP if they want to open a Health Savings Account and contribute to it.

But when it comes to HRA, there are 6 main types of accounts namely:
i.	Individual coverage (ICHRA) - Offered by the employer and covers individual health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical of the individual.
ii.	Qualified Small Employer (QSEHRA) - Employers who have less than 50 employees can leverage this HRA to coverindividual health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical of the employee.
iii.	Group coverage HRA - It is offered along with the group health plan andcan cover copayments, all or a portion of a higher deductible or any specific expense.
iv.	Excepted Benefit HRA - Can be only used for benefits like short-term medical, dental, vision, deductibles and other expenses.
v.	Retiree HRA–Helps retirees to pay for eligible medical expenses.
vi.	Section 105 HRA for 1 employee or spouse– Offered by the employer and covers individual health insurance premiums and all out-of-pocket medical of the individual.

Funding and Taxes
The funds for the HRA are contributed by the employer whereas HSA contributions can be made by the employer, employee or both.
HRA – Terms are set by the employer for expenses and eligible reimbursements. In addition to that, tax reductions can be taken by the employer only. However, the employee’s income doesn’t include HRA benefits.
HSA – IRS has laid out a set of guidelines for HSA eligible expenses. Usually, the account holder contributes to the account tax-free and earns tax-free interest on the account balance.  There are additional tax savings for the employee and the employer if the HSA bank savings are deducted at work via a Section 125 plan.
